# Quick question. If I have a dataset of 40+ variables and several rows that are entirely NA, how I can create a variable that will easily identify these rows so that I can remove them? I suppose this would be similar to using the COUNTA function in Excel and removing all with a COUNTA of 0.

# If you could go over how to remove entirely blank rows, and rows that are blank save for perhaps an ID code (and how the remove these rows), that would be great.
